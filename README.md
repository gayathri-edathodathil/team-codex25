### Project Description
**SpendWise** is an innovative **web-based digital wallet** designed exclusively for students. It integrates **AI-driven financial management, smart payments, and gamified savings incentives**—features that are missing from existing digital wallets.

With AI-powered **expense tracking, personalized budgeting tips, fraud detection, voice-enabled transactions, automated bill splitting, and parental monitoring options**, SpendWise helps students make informed financial decisions and develop better spending habits.

### The Problem statement
Managing finances effectively is a major challenge for students. Many struggle with **budgeting, tracking expenses, and making informed financial decisions**. Existing digital wallets lack student-specific features like **AI-driven budgeting, gamification, and automated expense tracking**. Without intelligent financial insights, students often overspend and mismanage their finances.

### **The Solution: SpendWise!**
 **Managing money as a student is tough**—unexpected expenses, peer pressure, and limited allowances make it even harder. Existing wallets track transactions, but they don’t understand student spending habits. That’s where **SpendWise** comes in!

✅ **Keep Track of everything!** – Expenses are tracked constatly and a visual representation of your spendings is plotted!

✅ **Anomaly Detection!** – Striking rise in the expense unusually is alerted to the user!

✅ **Stay Secure!** – AI-powered fraud detection spots unusual spending and alerts you before it’s too late.

✅ **Parental Peace of Mind (Optional!)** – Students can link accounts for controlled fund transfers and smart spending insights.

✅ **Save & Earn!** – Gamified budgeting makes saving fun—earn points, unlock badges, and get exclusive rewards for smart spending!

Our **AI-powered smart wallet** isn’t just a payment tool—it’s a **personal finance coach, expense tracker, and reward system** in one! 💰💡
